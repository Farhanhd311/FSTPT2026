    "description": "Forum Studi Transportasi antar Perguruan Tinggi (FSTPT) is a scientific forum established to foster interaction and communication among students, lecturers, and researchers from universities and institutions across Indonesia engaged in education, research, and community service in the transportation sector. FSTPT is realized through: (1) a mid-year national transportation seminar, (2) an end-of-year national transportation symposium, and (3) the International Symposium on Transportation and Sustainable Development Conference (ISTSDC), held biennially. These platforms serve as avenues for exchanging research findings, scientific studies, and professional experiences to strengthen the Tridharma of Higher Education and support national transportation research and innovation programs. Since its inception in 1998, the end-of-year symposium alone has featured nearly 6,000 presentations by students and lecturers in transportation sciences, while ISTSDC further expands international collaboration and knowledge exchange in sustainable transport development.",
